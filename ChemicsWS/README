This is the code framework for the Chemics REST web service, ChemicsWS.

ChemicsWS depends on the software packages ChemicsEndpoints and AZOrange, as well as on models and datasets stored in the ChemicsModelDir.

Hence, ChemicsWS  will use code from 3 different repositories:
ChemicsWS - local git repo: /disk1/jonsta/local/ChemicsWS
ChemicsEndpoints -local git repo /disk1/jonsta/local/ChemicsEndpoints
AZOrange - git repo on github https://github.com/JonnaStalring/AZOrange

ChemicsWS is assumed to be installed in a directory CHEMICSROOTPATH, within which also the ChemicsModelDir and ChemicsEndpoints directories are assumed to reside. 

ChemicsWS contains the code for the web service interface itself, while ChemicsEndpoints contains code which defines the available endpoints and how they are calculated. 

ChemicsModelDir is a directory structure containing models and data which have to be saved on disk. 


File structure relative to CHEMICSROOTPATH:

CHEMICSROOTPATH
	|
	|

	ChemicsModelDir		Directory structure for models and data sets that need to be saved on disk
        ChemicsEndpoints	The Endpoints directory contains one directory for each endpoint with code defining how the endpoint is calculated
	ChemicsWS
   		|
   		|
		ChemicsWS
			|
			|                
          		    -------- ChemicsWS.py  Exposes the URLs made available by the WS
          		    -------- startWS.sh    Use this script to start the WS and to get the correct environment. Dependence on AZO.


URLs:
=====

Please use the following URL for a complete list of available methods and their api:
ROOTURL/api/help 

Example URLs:
ROOTURL/endpoints 						Returns all available endpoints as defined by the directories in ChemicsEndpoints
ROOTURL/prediction/?endpoint/?ID/?smiles/?project/?series 	Returns a prediction and a confidence for endpoint	

Please note that special characters in the smiles string are assumed to be urlencoded!

project - should be an established project name in MVDB (Blanks are replaced by _ in the ChemicsModelDir file structure). If "None" the global model is used. 
series  - should be an integer or the string "None". If "None" the project specific model will be used.




Addition of new endpoints:
==========================

Addition of an endpoint does not require any changes of the ChemicsWS code, because the API of all endpoint methods is standardized to 5 input strings and 2 output strings. 
Input: endpoint, ID, smiles, project and series 
Ouput: prediction , confidence
The arguments can be dummy strings.  

However, a new endpoint has to be added to the ChemicsEndpoints repository within the Endpoints directory, which contains one directory for each endpoint. The endpoint directory should contain a python module, predict$endpoint.py, which consists of a method, $endpoint, with the API defined above. Please see existing endpoints within ChemicsEndpoints as an example.
