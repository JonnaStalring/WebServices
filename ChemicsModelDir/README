Model directory structure for Chemics models requiering data saved on disk.

The root directory (CHEMICSMODELDIR) contains one directory for each endpoint and the endpoint directory can contain a hierachy of global and local models. 
The local model directory may contain project and series specific models as displayed below. 

CHEMICSMODELDIR

	---------Endpoint
			|

			---------global

			---------local

                                  |
                                  -------projectX
                                            |
                                            ----Series1
                                            
It is assumed that for each existing model there is predict.py method at the apropriate level in the hierachy. 
Fore example, a series 1 specific model of potency for the RSV project would be located in the sub-directory:
CHEMICSMODELDIR/Potency/local/RSV_FUSION_INHIBITOR/Series1/predict.py

The predict methods take the smiles, ID and the path to the directory in which predict.py resides as an input and returns a prediction and a confidence.
